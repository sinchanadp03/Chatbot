To set up an Anaconda environment using Miniconda's command prompt (Anaconda Prompt on Windows or terminal on macOS/Linux), follow these steps:

**Install Miniconda:**
Download Miniconda from the Miniconda website (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) based on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
**Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux):**
After installing Miniconda, open Anaconda Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux. This is where you will run the commands to create and manage environments.

**Create a New Environment:**
To create a new environment, use the following command syntax:
**conda create --name myenv python=3.9**
Replace "myenv" with the name you want for your environment, and specify the Python version you want to use (e.g., Python 3.9).

**Activate the Environment:**
Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:
**conda activate myenv**

**Install Packages:**
With the environment activated, you can install packages using conda or pip. For example:
**conda install numpy pandas matplotlib**
